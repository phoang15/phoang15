## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello everyone, my name is Phillip Hoang. Computers have always been a big interest of mine since I was in middle school. I become interested in computer science because of all the awesome stuff that you can do within the field. Such as web/game development, cyber security, software engineering, etc. But due to me not caring much in high school about my grade, I enlisted into the Marine Corps to set my head straight. I served in an infantry unit from 2019 to 2023 as an anti-tank missileman and deployed twice. Now I am here in Northampton working to get an associates in computer science. I plan on transferring to a school in Philadelphia. The top three schools being University of Pennsylvania, Drexel, and Temple. I hope to learn a lot about code and find efficient ways to troubleshoot the work that we will do. Just being able to finally take computer science classes excites me. Since I was not able to for the past year due to me forgetting all of the things I learned in high school and not doing well on the math placement test. At the moment, I just hope to do well in college and be a better version of my past self. I enjoy playing videogames, going to the gym, and building computers for my family every now then.
